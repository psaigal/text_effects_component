# text_effects_component

This component was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows a user to input text and transform it to either 1) pig latin or 2) reversed text. The API exposes two methods: 1) setPigLatin and 2) setReverse.

This component was designed using the Revealing Module Design Pattern. The code achieves the following:
* Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* Create an API with public methods that other modules can interact with
* Private functions and variables should not be accessible to the public
* Separation of concerns (each function should be responsible for one task)
